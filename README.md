# create-vaxad-app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and customized by [vaxad](https://varad.vercel.app) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/UI, Prisma, a pre-made landing page, and custom components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Space Grotesk](https://vercel.com/font).
